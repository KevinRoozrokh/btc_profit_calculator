How to:

To code a web app similar to the one at the domain https://btcminingco.com/btc_calculator.html using the codebase from https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/btc_profit_calculator, you can follow the following step-by-step guide:

1. Set up the development environment:
   - Ensure you have a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your JavaScript code.
   - Create a new directory or project folder for your web app.

2. Clone the codebase:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/KevinRoozrokh/btc_profit_calculator.git
     ```

3. Open the HTML file:
   - In the cloned project folder, locate the `btc_calculator.html` file and open it in your text editor.

4. Review the existing code:
   - Read through the existing HTML code to understand the structure of the calculator web app.
   - Take note of any specific class names, IDs, or data attributes used in the HTML elements.

5. Create a JavaScript file:
   - In the same project folder, create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `btc_calculator.js`) and open it in your text editor.

6. Link the JavaScript file:
   - Inside the HTML file, add a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag.
   - Set the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag to link to your JavaScript file (e.g., `src="btc_calculator.js"`).

7. Write JavaScript code:
   - Inside the `btc_calculator.js` file, write your JavaScript code to implement the calculator functionality.
   - Select the necessary HTML elements using methods like `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, or `document.querySelectorAll()`.
   - Add event listeners to the appropriate elements to capture user input and trigger calculations.
   - Implement the necessary calculations based on the user input, using JavaScript math operators and functions.
   - Update the appropriate HTML elements to display the calculated results.

8. Style the web app:
   - Use CSS to style your web app and make it visually appealing.
   - Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and link it to the HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
   - Define CSS rules and styles for your HTML elements to control their appearance.

9. Test and debug:
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to test the functionality of your web app.
   - Use the browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect elements, check for errors, and debug your JavaScript code if needed.
   - Test different scenarios and inputs to ensure your app works as expected.

10. Deploy the web app:
    - Once you are satisfied with your web app, you can deploy it to a web server or hosting platform.
    - Upload the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files to a hosting service of your choice.
    - Ensure that the necessary files are correctly linked and accessible in the deployed environment.

11. Continuously maintain and update the app:
    - Monitor your web app for any reported issues or bugs.
    - Address and fix any identified problems promptly.
    - Implement new features or improvements based on user feedback or your own objectives.

Please note that the specific implementation details and functionality of the web app at the provided domain may not be fully covered in this general guide. It is recommended to review the actual codebase or any accompanying documentation for the web app to get a more accurate understanding of its implementation.
